### my framework for deeplearning using rust 
progress  :
- implementend activations as traits and structs
- impleented forward and  constructor for dense layer

- implement criterion (MSE) as trait also with loss_calc and d_loss_calc methods
- implement Optimizer trait with the step method
TO-DO:
- refactor self.x and self.z in the layer to be parametrs
- simple train loop
